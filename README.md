# Hi, I'm Nilson Molina

## Backend-Focused Software Engineer - PHP / Laravel

Backend-focused software engineer with experience working on production systems at different stages of maturity. Most of my work has been around Laravel-based platforms, APIs consumed by mobile applications, and data-intensive systems, where performance, data quality, and reliability are core concerns rather than secondary optimizations.

## Technical Focus

I tend to work close to system boundaries, making pragmatic technical decisions around backend architecture, data modeling, API contracts, and deployment workflows. My experience spans freelance, consulting, and in-house roles, with increasing technical ownership as an individual contributor.
